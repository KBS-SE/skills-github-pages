# Recording Scale Data to Excel using Python: A Practical Guide

![Scale Data Recording](https://www.smartlux.com/sdl/weight-recording-software/scale-with-data-logging-software/)

Have you ever needed to automate data recording from a weighing scale to an Excel spreadsheet? Whether it's for inventory management, data analysis, or any other purpose, this Python project can save you time and effort by automating the process. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to set up and execute a project that reads data from a weighing scale connected to your computer and records it in an Excel workbook.

## Project Overview

The project involves creating a Python script that communicates with a weighing scale via the computer's COM6 port. It reads the data from the scale, extracts relevant information, and adds it to an Excel spreadsheet for easy record-keeping. The script utilizes the `serial` library for serial communication and the `openpyxl` library for Excel manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- A weighing scale connected to your computer's COM6 port.
- Python installed on your system (version 3.x or higher).
- The `serial` and `openpyxl` libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyserial openpyxl
```

## Project Steps

### 1. Serial Port Configuration

First, set up a serial connection to the COM6 port using the `serial` library. This connection will allow the script to communicate with the weighing scale.

```python
import serial

ConnectScale = serial.Serial(port='COM6', baudrate=9600, timeout=100)
```

### 2. Excel Workbook Initialization

Open an existing Excel workbook using the `openpyxl` library. We'll use this workbook to record the scale data.

```python
import openpyxl

Scale_Data = openpyxl.load_workbook(r"C:\Users\Kody\Desktop\VALCO\Valco\Scale\Scale project\Scale_Data.xlsx")
DataSheet = Scale_Data.active
```

### 3. Data Retrieval and Processing

The script enters a loop to continuously read data from the COM6 port. When data is received, it's decoded and relevant information such as ID, Weight, Time, and Date is extracted.

```python
while ConnectScale.is_open:
    RealData = ConnectScale.read(60).decode()

    if len(RealData) >= 50:
        # Extract ID, Weight, Time, and Date
        Ids = RealData[1][11:]
        Weight = RealData[3][12:]
        Time = RealData[5][0:8]
        Dates = date.today()
        ExDate = Dates.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")
```

### 4. Data Recording in Excel

The extracted data is added to a list and then iterated over to add the data to a new row in the Excel sheet.

```python
ExData = [Ids, Weight, Time, ExDate]

# Add data to a new row in Excel
for column in range(1, 5, 1):
    rows = count
    DataSheet.cell(rows, column).value = ExData[column - 1]
count += 1
```

### 5. Save Excel Data

After adding the data, save the Excel workbook to persist the changes.

```python
Scale_Data.save(r"C:\Users\Kody\Desktop\VALCO\Valco\Scale\Scale project\Scale_Data.xlsx")
```

### 6. Buffer Management and Loop Termination

Clear the input buffer of the serial connection to remove residual data, and then close the serial connection and the Excel workbook.

```python
ConnectScale.reset_input_buffer()
ConnectScale.close()
Scale_Data.close()
```

## Running the Project

1. Connect your weighing scale to COM6 port.
2. Run the Python script you've created.

## Conclusion

Automating data recording from a weighing scale to an Excel spreadsheet can streamline your workflow and improve accuracy. This project demonstrates how to use Python to communicate with hardware, extract relevant data, and store it in an organized manner. Feel free to customize the code to match your requirements and integrate it into your projects.
